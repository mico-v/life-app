# 07 - Widget

## Current State

Home-screen widget support is not enabled in the current status-first version.

- `app/src/main/java/com/example/android16demo/widget/` is currently empty.
- No widget receiver/xml resources are wired in active manifest flow.

## Product Decision

The current MVP focuses on:
- web public status board
- mobile publish and read workflows

Widget can be added later when status presentation rules are finalized.
